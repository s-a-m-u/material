# Part 1 - Brainstorm: Statistics

## Distributions
### e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, ..

## Statistical Models
## Methods for Estimation
## Methods for Hypothesis Testing

# Part 2 - Brainstorm: Technologies in Biology

## microarray, sequencing, etc.

## In-class exercise 1 (1 technology for each row): microarray, Illumina sequencing, 3rd generation sequencing, cytometry, mass spectrometry

### Goal: 
#### produce a 2-3 point summary
#### links to a few (<5) good resources
#### create a markdown file for it; we will try a "group assignment" via GitHub

# Part 3 - Brainstorm: Applications in genomics 

### e.g., gene expression

# Part 4 - Brainstorm: Linking Technologies to Applications to Statistics (mainstream)

## e.g., microarray -> gene expression -> normally distributed (log intensities)

## In-class exercise 2 (in groups/rows): 
### Goal: make the link between technologies, what is measured, statistical models used
### For example:
##### RNA-seq: sequencing -> gene expression -> ?
##### BS-seq: bisulphite + sequencing -> DNA methylation -> ?
##### ChIP-seq: sequencing -> protein/DNA interactions -> ?

# Part 5 - Brainstorm: Methods/algorithms/data structures that are associated more to computer science

# Part 6 - Pick another "technology" (from those above, from [1] or another technology) to briefly describe

## In-class exercise 3 (in groups): 
### Goal: 
#### write ~2 sentences about what the method does
#### again, make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)
#### list the github usernames of everyone in your group
#### submit a pull request to brainstorm_modified.md


## RT-qPCR
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is used when the starting material is RNA. In this method, RNA is first transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase from total RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA). The cDNA is then used as the template for the qPCR reaction. RT-qPCR is used in a variety of applications including gene expression analysis, RNAi validation, microarray validation, pathogen detection, genetic testing, and disease research.[from ThermoFisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/molecular-biology-learning-center/molecular-biology-resource-library/basic-principles-rt-qpcr.html)
